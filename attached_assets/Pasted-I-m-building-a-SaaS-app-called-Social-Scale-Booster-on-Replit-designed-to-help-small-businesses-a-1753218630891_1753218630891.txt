I’m building a SaaS app called “Social Scale Booster” on Replit, designed to help small businesses and influencers schedule social media posts. The current URL is not live, which is blocking progress. I need you to diagnose and fix this issue so the dashboard is accessible.

Project Details:

Purpose: A social media scheduler with a dashboard for managing posts on platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn.
Tech stack: [Specify, e.g., “Node.js with Express, HTML/CSS for the frontend, or Flask if Python-based”].
Expected behavior: The URL should load a functional dashboard displaying [e.g., “a login page” or “a post-scheduling interface”].
Current issue: The URL doesn’t load (e.g., shows an error, times out, or displays a blank page).
Tasks:

Check the Replit project’s deployment status:
Confirm the project is running and generating a live URL in the Replit editor.
Verify the project is set to “Public” in Replit’s settings (not “Private”).
Output the correct live URL or confirm it matches the provided one.
Troubleshoot potential issues:
Check for code errors (e.g., missing index.html, incorrect server port, or dependency issues in package.json).
If using a backend (e.g., Express or Flask), ensure the server is listening on 0.0.0.0:8080.
Review error logs in Replit’s console and identify any issues (e.g., “port not bound” or “module not found”).
Suggest fixes:
If the project isn’t public, provide steps to make it public.
If the server configuration is wrong, provide corrected code (e.g., app.listen(8080, '0.0.0.0') for Express).
If dependencies are missing, list commands to install them (e.g., npm install express).
Output results:
Provide the corrected live URL or confirm the app is now accessible.
If the issue persists, give a detailed error report (e.g., “Error: Port 8080 not bound, fix by updating server.js to include…”).
Include a step-by-step explanation of what you checked and any changes made.
Output Format:

Start with: “Diagnosis: [Summary of the issue, e.g., ‘The project is private’ or ‘Server port misconfigured’].”
Follow with: “Fixes Applied: [List actions taken or suggested].”
End with: “Current Status: [e.g., ‘App is live at [new URL]’ or ‘Issue persists, see error details’].”
Please complete this within the next session and provide a clear, actionable response so we can get the app live and proceed with development.
